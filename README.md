  <h3>🔐 Visualize Brute Force Attacks. Understand Password Strength. Learn Security.</h3>
</div>

---

## ✨ Overview

**PassForceMeter** is an interactive Python tool that puts password security in the spotlight. Experience how brute force attacks operate, see every guess in real-time, and gain a vivid understanding of why strong passwords matter—all from your terminal.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Live Terminal Visualization**  
  Watch each character guessed in real-time with vibrant color feedback.

- **Step-by-Step Brute Force Simulation**  
  Simulates a brute force attack, guessing your password one character at a time from all printable ASCII characters.

- **Performance Stats**  
  Displays the total number of attempts and total time taken to crack the password.

- **Configurable Speed**  
  Adjust the animation speed for demonstration or rapid simulation.

- **Minimal Setup**  
  Python 3.x and one dependency (`colorama`).

- **Beginner Friendly & Extensible**  
  Easily modify for custom character sets, speed, or parallelization.

## 📦 Installation

**Make sure you have [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) installed, otherwise the project will not work correctly!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ALLAMEALLAME2020/PassForceMeter.git
cd PassForceMeter
pip install colorama
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

First you must to install **Colorama.**
```bash
pip install colorama
```
then :

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see:

```
[QS] > Enter a word to search for it! : yourpassword
```

Enter a password (short/long, simple/complex—your choice!) and watch the simulation.
